# Diamonds Data Exploration

## Dataset

The PISA database contains the full set of responses from individual students, school principals and parents. These files will be of use to statisticians and professional researchers who would like to undertake their own analysis of the PISA data. 

In this dataset we have results for 485'490 children between 15 years 3 months and 16 years 2 months old from around the world. Additionally we have exactly 636 columns and the whole dataset is larger than 2.5 GB. We need to find some Questions that we want to answer and only keep the columns that are needed for the data analysis.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I need to extract some column that I'm going to use to analyze the data. Also I wrote down some question that I'm going to answer throughout the analysis. First I extract a certain country including Korea and Finland. When it comes to math anxiety and attribution to failure, I need to handle this column. Each of variable has unique scale value in string, which I need to give a certain value to calculate later. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the comparison between Korea and Finland. In conclusion, the student living in Korea tend to feel more anxiety than the Finland student, which I assumed. There are 5 types of anxiety, but overall Korean student have high level of anxiety. When it comes to attribution to failure in Math test, both of country think that their material is not good and that's the part of reason they get bad score in math. Before analyzing this data, I fairly confident the Finland student are not worry about that much about math but it turned out they're worried about getting a bad score in test as korean student did. Plus I assumed that the more they have high anxiety about math, the less they get good grade in math test, which is not true. There is no correlationship between variables I used
